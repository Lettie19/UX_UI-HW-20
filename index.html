          <h2>The problem</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We have observed that the current design layout and information structure of the website aren’t meeting these goals which <br>is causing busy and impatient users to waste time attempting to locate information and potentially miss out on possible <br>events/opportunities to donate and participate. 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text2">How might we improve the design of the international Child Art Foundation’s website so that users are able to<br> easily locate information about the organization, its initiatives and opportunities to support?</p>

      </div>
      <div class="cardsolution">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h1 class="solution">The Solution</h5>
          <p>We focused our redesign on three key features based on our user research results and brainstorming sessions: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>UX/UI Designer</li>
            <li>We increased usability by improving the content hierarchy to make it easier for users to accomplish the task of locating information specific to their <br>needs on the website. 
                </li>
            <li>Optimized the website navigation bar</li>
            <li>Finally, we modernized the layout of the website by adding in more color, using modern typography and increasing negative space between <br>text and cards.</li>

      <h3>01. Research</h3>

      <div class="cardsolution">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h1 class="solution">Stakeholder's Goals</h5>
          <p>Our research started with me interviewing The ICAF’s founder to find out what the ICAF is all about. This was incredibly helpful, as it enabled us to <br>
            gain more insight into the organization and put emphasis on the things most important to the organization. I also remained in constant communication <br>with the organizaton’s CFO to inform them of our progress and confirm some design decision . Key insights from the interview:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website has to be both playful and academic</li>
            <li>How can the site better drive donations?</li>
            <li>Ensure redesign includes flagship event -  6th Arts Olympiad</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="cardsolution">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h1 class="solution">Heuristics Analysis</h1>
          <p>After talking to our client, we conducted a heuristic evaluation of the ICAF’S websited for usability, accessibility, and universal <br> design principle. We observed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Color contrast made it challenging for users to read text</li>
            <li>The page didn't have much content hierarchy</li>
            <li>The information architecture wasn't clear and consistent</li>
            <p class="cardimg2"><img src="images/icaf.gov.gif"></p>
        </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="cardsolution">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h1 class="solution">Qualitative Interviews</h1>
          <p>We conducted user interviews and asked four users to complete three key tasks to assess the functionality of the current site.  The research helped us <br>understand the needs of our users and also validated the findings from our heuristic analysis. 
        </p>
        </div>

      <div class="cardinsight">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h2 class="insight">User Insights</h2>
          <p class="card-text2">After gathering and analyzing the data from our user interviews, we were able to summarize them into these key <br> insights help us understand our user pain points. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="insightslist">The navigation bar isn't clear and is misleading</li>
            <li class="insightslist">The custom 404 error message is unclear</li>
            <li class="insightslist">The pages are heavy on text and lack clarity and hierarchy</li>
            <li class="insightslist">The organizatin's mission is unclear from looking at the landing page</Li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <p class="sitemap">From our testing, we focused on over 25 data points we wanted to include in our redesign. Taking into consideration our stakeholder’s goals  and the <br> results of our testing. we decided on three key features for the redesign to have a modern site layout, consistent navigation throughout the site, <br> and better organization of the content across the site.
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg3"><img src="images/Group feature prioritization 3886.png"></p>
    <p>We were able to prioritize these features mainly by understanding and empathizing with our user, Joe Stephens. Joe is a public art teacher <br> and he thrives off of the passion he sees when his students can express themselves through their work. This has been especially difficult with virtual <br> learning and he has seen the impact it has had on his students. He started looking for more ways to inspire his kids and thought the ICAF would be <br> the best to accomplish that. 
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg4"><img src="images/Group user persona 3860.png"></p>

    <h3>02. Ideation</h3>
    <p class="sitemap">In the redesign process we were inspired not only by the organization’s mission which is centered around children and the arts and also our <br>stakeholder’s goals to have the site be a little bit more colorful and engaging. We selected a color palette that communicated those objectives and <br>choose a typography that communicated more of aprofessional tone. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="solution">Style Guide</h1>
    <p class="cardimg3"><img src="images/Group style tile 3887.png"></p>
    <h1 class="solution">Sitemap</h1>
    <p class="sitemap">With a better understanding of our user journey, we conducted a card sorting exercise and redesigned the sitemap to be more intuitive and <br> organized. We wanted to o ensure that the navigation for the site was easier and more straightforward for those parents, students and <br> teachers that would be interested in participating in one of the ICAF’s programs. We also wanted any potential donors or sponsors to quickly <br> access resources and pertinent info about the organization. 
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg3"><img src="images/Group sitemap 3878.png"></p>
    <h3>03. Prototyping & Testing</h3>
    <h1 class="solution">Early Concepts</h1>
    <p class="sitemap">Using the insights we gathered from our research, the team started createing user flows. <br>
        We started sketching the information architecture and lo-fi concept to be used for our redesign.  After reviewing our designs against our research and once <br>we were confident about our sketchees, we began digitalizing them and I designed our mid and hi-fi prototypes.
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg3"><img src="images/Group early concepts 3888.png"></p>
    <p class="sitemap">We conducted several levels of testing with 8 users to determine if our design  was solving the  user’s pain points discovered during our research <br> phase. 
        We made a couple of iterations to our designs based on the feedback from our usability testing.  
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg4"><img src="images/Group 3899.png"></p>
    <h3>04. The Solution</h3>
    <p class="sitemap">A new redesigned , usable, easy to navigate and vibrant site to increase user engagement and donations.  
        We comlpeted our redesign of the four pages we are set out to improve and were confident to present the final product to our stakeholder <br> after the last round of testing had a 100% completion rate for all tasks.
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg5"><img src="images/THE SOLUTION.png"></p>
    <h1 class="solution">Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p class="sitemap">We focused on buidling the website as  that was our main goal within the time frame we were given. However, with some days left before <br> submission, we were able to design a mobile version of the website. We designed two unique mobile layouts for the landing page and tested them for <br> UI preference and navigation with 24 users. I designed layout A and my teammate designed the more interactive layout B.
    </p>
    <p class="cardimg4"><img src="images/Group RWD 3895.png"></p>
    <h1 class="solution">Additional Screens</h1>
    <p class="cardimg4"><img src="images/additoinal screens.png"></p>
    <p class="sitemap">As a final step, we presented the final redesign to our stakeholder and his webmaster who both approved of the redesigned and confirmed that we <br> targeted and resolved the key pain points as per our initial interview and also based on data from research. Elements of the redesign <br> will be implemented on their final redesign.
    </p>
    <h3>05. Further Development</h3>
    <h1 class="solution">Key Learnings</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class ="learnings">Usability  >  Beautitful design - As our UI preference reaffirmed, as UX/UI designers, we have to make sure that our we do not place a <br> beautiful design over user experience. The designer’s objective is first to ensure that the app is easy to use, intuite and usable.  It is important <br>to already consider and reassess the reason behind design decisions. </li>
        <li class ="learnings">Qualitative data for different types of users’ insights  - Adding a survey in our research migth have provided us with more insight from <br>different user groups that the website target - more specifically students and children. It would also have been helpful in creating a different <br> user persona who is a child. Unfortunately, without much time and access to children, we were not able to gather that data.</li>
        <li class ="learnings">Time Management is Essential  - As we juggled our office day jobs, night classes and project deadlines, it became even more clear to us after <br> the third day on the project that regular standups and updating of our Trello board was necessary to keep track of our deliverables and ensure <br> that we completed all our research and data analysis and synthesis in time for us to begin sketching and digitalizing our designs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="solution">Next Steps</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class ="steps">Logo Redesign  - We initially thought about adding some color to the logo to make it more fitting to the brand of the organziation but our <br> client was not sure about the idea. I would consider  proposing different iterated versions of the logo to our client to provide him with a visual <br> that may give him a better understanding of the vision and see if he would want to proceed in that direction.</li>
        <li class ="steps">Break down the donation page into different pages with progress indicator -  The current donation page could be broken down into <br> different pages to reduce the amount of information the users have to see from first landing on the page. An A/B testing or user preference <br> test would determine whether the change allows for better user experience.</li>
